## Project
Three versions of the popular game `Wordle`. The first is a command-line version developed in the `TypeScript` language, following the functional programming paradigm. The second is a version in `React-Native` for web and mobile. The third version is also in `React-Native`, but has many additional features, such as `Dordle`, a version of the game with two game boards and some `API` functionalities such as persistence, sharing, haptics and definition of the words through an external API. 

Instructions on how to run the two projects can be found in the specific folders:
* [Wordle-Typescript/](Wordle-Typescript)
* [Wordle-React/](Wordle-React)
* [Wordle-React-Advanced/](Wordle-React-Advanced)

## Application demo

* Working demo of the command line version: https://replit.com/@samdalvai/WordleCommandLine#index.ts
* Working demo of the React version: https://snack.expo.dev/@samdalvai/wordle-react

Please note that for the two `React` versions of the application, if you want to run the mobile version of the app, you will need to install the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) application on your smartphone. Some functionalities of the game are restricted only to the mobile version, for example "sharing" your win.
